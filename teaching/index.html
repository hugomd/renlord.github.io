<h1 id="teaching">Teaching</h1>

<p>I teach or have teached the following subjects in the School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne:</p>

<ul>
<li>COMP30023 Computer Systems [2017, 2018, 2019], Teaching Assistant</li>
<li>COMP90043 Cryptography and Security [2015, 2018], Teaching Assistant</li>
<li>SWEN90006 Software Testing [2018, 2019], Teaching Assistant</li>
<li>COMP90007 Internet Technologies [2016], Teaching Assistant</li>
</ul>

<p>On some years, I am more involved with subject assessment designs and marking, but usually I only help run tutorials and help out students with questions.</p>

<p>I am an open book and open to criticism, here&rsquo;s what my students have had to say about me:</p>

<h3 id="comp30023-computer-systems">COMP30023 Computer Systems</h3>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Had some very interesting discussions as a class about how the internet really works, with real life examples making content relevant. Made class worth coming to at 9am. Clear diagrams on the whiteboard to explain concepts were good for understanding.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2017</li>
<li>&ldquo;Renlord is the best, and is able to explain concepts taught in the lecture that were very unclear. He makes me believe that I am able to pass to pass this subject. <sup>11</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2017.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Explanations were very clear and went above and beyond what we covered in lectures. We were also strongly encouraged to put these things into practise in our own time.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2017.</li>
<li>&rdquo;- good discussions including useful material outside of what was covered in lectures - clear explanations - a sense of humour.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2017.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Great tutorial, Renlord has been really helpful in helping me understand the concepts. The lectures can be too quick and too detail orientated so these tutorials have been really important in helping me really consolidate and learn. I&rsquo;d really be struggling without these tutes. Tutorial exercises have been amazing - they really tackle the core components of the subject. I like how Renlord draws diagrams and pictures to explain. Analogies for certain conceptual concepts have been really great as well (i.e. IP address = Street address, Port number = Apartment number).&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2017.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Fun, cheery mood of the tutor and good spirit for learning. Enjoyed the variety and accuracy of his knowledge.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2017.</li>
<li>&ldquo;His explanations are excellent&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2018.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It would be good if he code explain the code more.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2018</li>
<li>&ldquo;Interesting real-life examples and explanations by the tutor Great involvement&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2018.</li>
<li>&ldquo;His explanations are excellent&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2019.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Renlord knows the material really well&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2019.</li>
<li>&ldquo;He is always very helpful, it feels like a Q &amp; A session not only for tutorial materials but also for lecture related stuff. He always tends to explain more detailed than what I expected. E.g. for my tute, all of us gather around and he helped us understand the code that is used for lab 6 which is crucial for the project. I am glad to say that I received full 15 marks for project 1 on the first marking and it is mainly because of his teaching style.    &ldquo; &ndash; anon, 2019</li>
<li>&rdquo;-poor coordination with the lecturers: sometimes the tutorial material didn&rsquo;t reflect the lecture material, probably since the syllabus was changed from last year. -presentation of material: the tutor sort of left each table group to do the tutorial questions on our own, and only came around when we were unsure.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2019</li>
<li>&ldquo;I would really hope that the tutor (Renlord Yang) learns some etiquettes when it comes to replying to people via email. The sheer arrogance you receive when you send him a serious doubt/concern is frustrating and infuriating to the point where I would rather prefer to send my doubts to another tutor of another class who I don&rsquo;t even know. If you&rsquo;re reading this, please be reminded that your job is to help people not discourage them from voicing their doubts/concerns no matter how stupid they might sound to you. I get that you&rsquo;re in charge of a lott of students and must be inundated with doubts and your own study load, you are being paid well for the same. Apart from this, you do have a good grasp on your fundamentals and subject.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2019</li>
<li>&ldquo;While his teaching was really good, Renlord sometimes sounds a tad condescending when answering questions from students.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2019</li>
<li>&ldquo;When student addresses a problem of marking, this tutor insisted they are corrected even without actually checking it, and replied with a very bad attitude.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2019</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;He explained some principles clearly and went through the whole schemes step by step.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2018.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sometimes a little too fast. If there is a review on previous lessons and how the new contents are linked with the previous ones, it would be helpful for our understanding.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2018.</li>
<li>&ldquo;clearer blackboard writing needed&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2018.</li>
<li>&ldquo;It will be better if he could talk more about the questions in the tutorial and speak more slowly.&rdquo; &ndash; anon, 2018.</li>
</ul>

<p>Funnily, I have only received most of the written comments (which are optional) on my teaching for COMP30023 Computer Systems only.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a student enrolled in my class, I encourage you to write something in the end-of-semester survey.
They usually are much more interesting to me than a set of useless numbers.</p>
