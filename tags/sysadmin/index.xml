      <title>Self Hosting a Mail Transfer Agent</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, Daniel from Graphene OS suggested to me that I should just self-host my own emails as many email providers do not properly setup the latest security extensions that help realise better security for email. To that end, I have decided to also self-host my own MTA &amp;ndash; which now runs as katmail.xyz.
Email hosting is akin to setting up a virtual post-office, responsible for managing all electronic mail leaving and arriving for a set of mdomains handled by the delegated Mail Transfer Agent.</description>
