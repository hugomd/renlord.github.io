      <description>As you all known from my things page, I run a multiarch cluster of nodes to run a variety of my services. More often than not, service images provided by maintainers only support x86 and x86_64 architectures. As a consequence of this, I have to self-build my service images.
When it was just building for one type of architecture (i.e. arm32) for my Odroid XU4, it was not so bad.</description>

      <description>Things Communication I use the following chat services (in order of personal preference):
 Wire (@renlord) IRC on irc.freenode.net (@renlord) Signal [2] Whatsapp [1]  [1] Whatsapp is particularly difficult to ween off since most of the people I talk to use Whatsapp and despite efforts to convince them to adopt Signal/Wire, they&amp;rsquo;ve still refused to do so. I&amp;rsquo;m tentatively tolerant of my usage of Whatsapp since IIUC Whatsapp is still not fully integrated into Facebook Inc.</description>
