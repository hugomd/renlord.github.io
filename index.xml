      <description>Things Services and Hardware I self-host a good number of services on my inexpensive private cluster of ARM single-board computers (SBCs). I currently own an Odroid XU4, Odroid-N2 and Raspberry Pi 3. Out of the three, I am most satisfied with the Odroid XU4 which runs on armv7hl.
My setup involves setting Docker Swarm and each service is then spun up using a docker-compose.yml file. For storage, I have disk drives physically mounted in one of my nodes and I share the NAS using NFS with LAN.</description>
