      <description>As you all known from my things page, I run a multiarch cluster of nodes to run a variety of my services. More often than not, service images provided by maintainers only support x86 and x86_64 architectures. As a consequence of this, I have to self-build my service images.
When it was just building for one type of architecture (i.e. arm32) for my Odroid XU4, it was not so bad. Once I added another node, my arm64 Odroid-N2, it started to become a hassle to manually author custom Dockerfiles to build for each architecture by hand.</description>

      <description>Teaching My teaching is strongly focused on motivating students to draw relevance from academic material. More concretely, I aid students in understanding material within the context of real-life problems and constraints faced in systems engineering.
I teach or have taught the following subjects in the School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne:
 COMP30023 Computer Systems (Archives) [2017, 2018, 2019], Teaching Assistant COMP90043 Cryptography and Security (Archives) [2015, 2018], Teaching Assistant SWEN90006 Software Testing [2018, 2019], Teaching Assistant COMP90007 Internet Technologies [2016], Teaching Assistant  On some years, I am more involved with subject assessment designs and marking.</description>

      <description>Things Communication I use the following chat services (in order of personal preference):
 Signal IRC on irc.freenode.net (@renlord) Whatsapp [1] Wire (@renlord) NOT USED ANYMORE  [1] Whatsapp is particularly difficult to ween off since most of the people I talk to use Whatsapp and despite efforts to convince them to adopt Signal/Wire, they&#39;ve still refused to do so. I&#39;m tentatively tolerant of my usage of Whatsapp since IIUC Whatsapp is still not fully integrated into Facebook Inc.</description>
