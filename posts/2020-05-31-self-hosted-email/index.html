<p>A couple of weeks ago, Daniel from Graphene OS suggested to me that I should just self-host my own emails as many email providers do not properly setup the latest security extensions that help realise better security for email.
To that end, I have decided to also self-host my own MTA &ndash; which now runs as katmail.xyz.</p>
<p>Email hosting is akin to setting up a virtual post-office, responsible for managing all electronic mail leaving and arriving for a set of mdomains handled by the delegated Mail Transfer Agent.
Several internet standards help realise these functionalities and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</li>
<li>Domain Name System (DNS)</li>
<li>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) / DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)</li>
<li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461">MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security)</a></li>
<li>DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) using TSLA Records secured using DNSSEC</li>
</ul>
<p>In this blog post, I will talk about realising encrypted communication between
MTAs over the internet to better improve security and privacy for email
correspondence.</p>
<h2 id="domain-name-system">Domain Name System</h2>
<p>The functionality of DNS in Email should be obvious to everyone.
MX records are used to delegate a 3rd-party mail provider or mail server responsible for receiving mail for a domain.
A records are used to resolve names to IPv4 addresses.
In addition to that, if a domain is secured using DNSSEC, additional records
such as (Transport Layer Security Authentication) TSLA record can be added to
be perform DANE.
So how exactly does this work?
We know that TLS requires public key encryption.
Taking HTTP web services as an example, when you first load a webpage and
negotiate a TLS session between the server and a client, you will first
download a HTTPS certificate signed by a CA.
This certificate <strong>authenticates</strong> the public key which is published by the web server.
Within the email ecosystem, there is no standard for using signed CA certificates, or it is just uncommon to do so.
Instead, the authentication of email server public keys is done via creating a
TSLA record which publishes the public key used to setup TLS over SMTPS or
STARTTLS, preventing the dreaded Man-in-the-Middle attack for emails going
forward.
For this authentication to be verified securely, the opportunistic DANE lookup
must use a DNSSEC-enforcing DNS resolver, otherwise, an adversary can of course
trivially fake a DNS records for a domain.</p>
<p>In summary, DNS lets us define where emails sent to ourselves should go to and
it also lets us publish authenticated keying material for setting up TLS.</p>
